# so_long

So_long is the first graphics project from Ecole 42, and it challenges students to implement a simple 2D game using the MinilibX graphics library

The game is a maze, and the player must navigate through the maze to collect collectibles and reach the exit


## Installation

To use so_long, simply clone the repository and compile it with your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/so_long.git
cd so_long
make
```
This will generate an executable called so_long that you can run to start the game


## Usage

To play the game, simply run the so_long executable with the path to a valid map file:

```bash
./so_long maps/map.ber
```
This will start the game with the specified map file

The game can be controlled using WASD keys, and the objective is to collect all collectibles and unlock the exit portal to finish the game
