So_long is a graphical project at Ecole 42 that involves creating a simple 2D game using the MinilibX graphic library

The objective of the game is for the player to navigate a character through a maze to collect collectibles and reach the end point without colliding with any obstacles

The project requires the implementation of basic game mechanics, such as character movement and collision detection, as well as more advanced graphics programming techniques, such as rendering textures and handling animations


## Installation

To use so_long, simply clone the repository and compile it with your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spookier/so_long.git
cd so_long
make
```
This will generate an executable called so_long that you can run to start the game


## Usage

To play the game, simply run the so_long executable with the path to a valid map file:

```bash
./so_long maps/map.ber
```
This will start the game with the specified map file

The game can be controlled using WASD keys, and the objective is to collect all collectibles and unlock the exit portal to finish the game
